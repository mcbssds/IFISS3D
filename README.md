# IFISS3D
The <b> IFISS3D toolbox</b> extends the IFISS finite element software package for MATLAB to <b> three dimensional</b> spatial domains and is
associated with the following preprint: <br>
<ul> 
<li> Georgios Papanikos, Catherine E. Powell, David J. Silvester, <b> IFISS3D: A computational laboratory for investigating finite element approximation in three dimensions. </b>
  </ul> 


To install IFISS3D the gzipped file must be unzipped and the folder <b> diffusion3D </b> placed into the top-level directory of the
IFISS package. 

The installation of the IFISS package is documented at
https://manchester.ac.uk/ifiss/download.html

If installing IFISS3D on a windows machine then you will also need to type <br>
$>>$ install_pc3D <br>
at the prompt, before running the software for the first time. After installation, type <br> 
$>>$ helpme_diff3D <br>
to get started.

Result for test problems can be reproduced by following the instructions in the diary files testproblem1.txt, testproblem2.txt and testproblem3.txt.
