# IFISS3D
Extension of IFISS software package to <b> three dimensional approximation</b>.


The m-files in this directory are associated with the preprint: <br>
<ul> 
<li> Georgios Papanikos, Catherine E. Powell, David J. Silvester, <b> IFISS3D: A computational laboratory for investigating finite element approximation in three dimensions. </b>
  </ul> 

To install IFISS3D the gzipped file must be unzipped into the top-level directory of the
IFISS package. The installation of the IFISS package is documented at
https://manchester.ac.uk/ifiss/download.html

If installing IFISS3D on a windows machine then you will also need to type <br>
$>>$ install_pc3D <br>
at the prompt, before running the software for the first time. After installation, type <br> 
$>>$ helpme_diff3D <br>
to get started.

The <b> test problem </b> diary files are the following: <br>
<ul>
<li> testproblem1.txt <br>
<li> testproblem2.txt <br>
<li> testproblem2.txt <br>
</ul>
