# IFISS3D
Extension of IFISS software package to <b> three dimensional approximation</b>.


The m-files in this directory are associated with the preprint
<b> IFISS3D: A computational laboratory for investigating finite element approximation in three dimensions </b>

To install IFISS3D the gzipped file must be unzipped into the top-level directory of the
IFISS package. The installation of the IFISS package is documented at
https://manchester.ac.uk/ifiss/download.html

If installing IFISS3D on a windows machine then you will also need to type
